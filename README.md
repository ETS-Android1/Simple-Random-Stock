# Simple Random Stock

Randomly select a stock from your favorite U.S index and have them saved in your history for future uses. 
I created this application as a side project. I wanted to accomplish what I thought was impossible. I'm interested in the finance field. I wasn't able to find an app that would randomly select a stock for my style. Thus, I created this app.

### Technologies

Simple Random stock uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

  - [Room Database] - Use SQLite to cache your app's data locally
  - [Lifecycles] - to perform certain actions in response to a component's lifecycle
  - [MaterialIO] - The Web equivalent of Bootstrap for Mobile
  - [Unsplash] - image by Ankush Minda on Unsplash 
  - [Gradle] - build tool for obtaining dependencies
  - [Dillinger] - open source tool to create this README.md

### Launch

- No minimum hardware requirments
- Have Android Studios
- Fork or clone a copy of this repo and allow gradle to handle the build process
- Click 'run' on SplashScreen located in the package .../splashscreens/SplashScreenActivity and the app will load

### Development

Want to contribute? Great! Submit a pull request

### Todos

 - Write MORE Tests
 - Add Night Mode
 - Maybe come up with a way to run the app originally on MainActivity, instead of SplashScreenActivity
